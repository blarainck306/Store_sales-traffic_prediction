# Store_sales-traffic_prediction

Currently, sales and traffic prediction uses two separate models for prediction. So the codes are almost identical except that we use predicted sales as features when predicting traffic. Later, we may use a single neural network for multi-task learning prediction.
To review the codes, please start with the sales directory.

- ipython notebooks in each directory have uses suggested by their names:
1.data exploration
2.feature engineering
3.model training


- utility.py:  contains some function used by ipython notebook
- visulization.py: for data visualization
